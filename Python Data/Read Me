# HMIS Medallion ETL (Python + pandas)

Production-style ETL pipeline for homeless services analytics (HMIS/CES, case notes, services, enrollments).  
Designed for auditability, deterministic logic, and non-technical coworker execution.

## Objectives

- Transform HMIS exports and locally maintained CES files into clean, join-ready datasets
- Build reporting-ready “Gold” tables with deterministic business rules and flags
- Preserve lineage and reproducibility (file manifests, QA outputs, deterministic sorting)
- Support coworker execution with minimal steps and consistent outcomes

## Architecture

This project implements a **Medallion Architecture** using free tools:

- **Bronze**: Raw extracts (CSV/Excel) as received (no business logic)
- **Silver**: Cleaned, normalized, typed, and join-ready tables
- **Gold**: Business logic, KPIs, readiness flags, and reporting tables

All outputs are partitioned by `pull_date`:
